ED Patient Arrival Forecasting with Multiple Variables using Vector Autoregression (VAR), Facebook Prophet and LSTM algorithms.
These models revealed how significant forecasting models could be important for both current and future studies in the Healthcare industry with LSTM showing promising results over other models with significant low RMSE values. These low values were obtained after performing feature engineering. This considered relevant factors as exogenous variables for all models used that were likely to have impacted the variability of the dataset. These factors included climatic conditions and COVID-19 restrictions.

N.B: The findings of the study has produced 2 journal articles that are currently under review in two high impact factor health-care journals
